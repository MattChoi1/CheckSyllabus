Learning Outcomes:  
  
As a result of this course experience, students should be able to:   
1.  describe and discuss the structure of macromolecules and their functions in pro- and 

eukaryotic cells.  

problems.  

2.  describe and discuss bioenergetics; the cell cycle and gene expression.   
3.  use Mendelian and molecular genetics to solve problems.  
4.  understand various forms of graphical and quantitative data and apply data to solve 

5.  employ the scientific method: (identify problem or question,  develop hypothesis, design 

experiments to test hypothesis, reach  conclusion).
