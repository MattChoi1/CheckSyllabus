COURSE DESCRIPTION: 
In the fall, students explore enduring questions and ideas in the liberal arts tradition through 
reading, discussing, and writing on provocative works drawn from such fields as philosophy, 
literature, religion, and science. All fall sections read the same "core" of common works selected 
by the faculty teaching E&D that semester. Yet each section is also unique, exploring its own 
theme and reading its own additional materials. This year's common works, read in all sections, 
include selections from The Bible, as well as writings by Plato, Virgil, and Freud. Students 
compose four or more essays (totaling 20 pages) on these and other course readings, and take a 
midterm and a final exam. Students are also invited to attend an evening series of E&D Lectures 
and/or films related to the common readings. 
 
SECTION DESCRIPTION: 
Each faculty member teaching a section of E&D has written a description of their course.  You 
can review the offered sections and their descriptions on the E&D website:

ATTENDANCE is crucial to this course.  When you are ill, please send me an email and let me 
know that you will not be in class (or send me an email soon after you are well enough to do so).  
You may miss up to three classes for illness or other emergencies.  Each additional absence, 
however, will reduce your course grade by one-third (e.g., from an A- to a B+).  Latecomers 
receive partial absences.  
If you are absent, you are still responsible for knowing the material and for turning in any 
assignments for that day.  I recommend that you exchange phone numbers with several 
classmates so that you can keep up. 
 
ACADEMIC INTEGRITY: You can read our policies on Academic Integrity & Academic 
Freedom in Pathfinder.  You should have already completed the on-line Academic 
Integrity/Plagiarism tutorial and submitted your on-line acknowledge form, if you haven’t, 
please do so now at http://library.lclark.edu/reference/plagiarism/index.htm Consult with me 
about questions.   
 
INTELLECTUAL HONESTY: Do not represent someone else’s work as your own.  Bear in 
mind that plagiarism, even when unintentional, is a serious offense with serious consequences.  
 
ACCOMODATIONS: If you have a disability that may impact your academic performance, you 
may request accommodations by submitting documentation to the Student Support Services 
Office in Albany Quadrangle (x7191), and that office will notify me of the accommodations for 
which you are eligible.

CLASS PARTICIPATION: This will not be a lecture-based course.  Its success depends upon 
your informed participation in our class discussions.  I expect you to come to class prepared to 
seriously and respectfully engage with each other and each other’s work.  I expect you to come 
to class prepared to ask and respond to challenging questions about the texts at hand 
 
Perfect attendance and attentive listening will earn you a passing participation grade, but a better 
than passing grade requires that you make valuable contributions to virtually every class 
discussion.  Articulate and insightful contributions will earn the most credit, especially if they 
emerge as part of an actual discussion in which you are listening to and responding to your 
classmates. 
 
DO ALL THE ASSIGNED READING for a given day as well as you can.  Bring questions.  We 
will not be able to discuss all the reading but you are responsible for all of it. 
LATE POLICY: Essays and other reading and writing assignments are due at the beginning of 
class on the due date.  Essays will be graded down one letter grade for each day they are late.  
You will not receive credit for journals if they are not submitted on time.  You will receive a zero 
on class presentations if you fail to show up for them.  You will receive a zero for quizzes given 
on days that you are absent.  (I will drop your two lowest quiz grades.) 
 
COMPUTER OR PRINTER PROBLEMS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED AS EXCUSES FOR 
LATE WORK.  Always make copies of your work and save them until the term is over.  Print 
out drafts of your work as you go.  Computer or printer problems will not be accepted as excuses 
for late work; if your printer doesn’t work, email your assignment to yourself as an attachment 
and then print from one of the computer labs, e.g. the library.  Leave yourself enough time to 
recover from printer problems.  Back up your work.  Please put your name and page # in the 
Header, use standard font and margins, double-space, and staple all work. 
 
PLEASE use the restroom before class.   
 
TURN OFF YOUR CELL PHONES before class.  Cell phone disruptions will adversely affect 
your grade. 
 
IN THE CLASSROOM, mature conduct is, of course, expected at all times.  In case there is any 
confusion about this, here are a few of the very basics: Don’t roll your eyes and sigh when you 
disagree with what someone is saying.   Don’t interrupt your classmates.  Don’t talk (or whisper) 
(or pass notes) when they are talking.  Insults (even when you are “just kidding”), dismissive 
tone or body language, and interjections off of topic are obviously inappropriate and they will 
adversely affect your grade.  Please no eating, gum chewing, or knitting in class.  Repeated 
inappropriate behavior will lead to dismissal from the course with an “F.”   
 
Here are a few suggestions on how to contribute to class discussions. 
 

•  Offer your perspective on a topic, even if you think it differs from “everyone else’s.”    
•  Refer to passages in the text, providing page number, place on the page, in the 
paragraph beginning with __x__.  Read the whole sentence (or more to provide 
context) that leads into the point that interests you.

•  Bring in relevant contemporary issues and examples, including relevant personal 

experience, or connections to what you are learning in other classes. 

•  Look up words or key references in the dictionary, online, or in the library and send 
to our class on the listserv along with a note explaining its relevance.  Own and use a 
dictionary.  (For historical definitions use the OED (Oxford English Dictionary), 
available free online via the Watzek Library reference page.   Look up words you 
don’t know and, especially in the older texts we will be reading, look up unusual 
usages of words to learn 17th or 18th C. definitions that differ from contemporary 
usage. 

•  Follow up on a point raised in class by someone else.  Ask a question or build upon 

an idea.   

•  Everyone is responsible for the quality of the discussion as a whole.  Listen, and then 
point to what is being left out of a discussion, or redirect the discussion by bringing in 
another passage or perspective that you find interesting and pertinent. 

•  Address comments to the entire class (not just to me); refer to your classmates by 

name.  Example: “I think what Alex said about _____was  ______ because______.” 
•  Show evidence that you are trying to learn.  Demonstrate that you are willing to try 

out a variety of possible interpretations.  

•  Make contributions to the topic under discussion that are serious, playful, 

imaginative—in other words fully engaged.
